    <h1>Low and Slow</h1>
    <p>
      This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about cooking technique called
      <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous vide</em> cooking,you the food
      (usually vacuum sealed in plastic) into a water bath thar is 
      set to the target temperature you want to be cooked to. In his book,
      <em>Cooking fir Geeks</em>, Jess Potter describes ir as "ultra-low
      temperature poaching".

      Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b>. To reserve a seat ar the chef table, contact us before November 30. </p>
